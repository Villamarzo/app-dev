**Story**
Lokiplunges the audience right into the action, borrowing the 2012 time heist scene from Avengers: Endgame to keep things clear about who this Loki is. He’s a variant who just tried to conquer Earth after the Battle of New York, who also manages to get ahold of the Tesseract and use it to escape to Mongolia, only for him to be trailed and arrested by agents from the Time Variance Agency. They reset that alternate timeline to its right course and take him to their headquarters – where anomalies that step out of the course of the Sacred Timeline (a.k.a. variants) are judged and/or pruned (a.k.a. disintegrated.)

In the TVA, Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s Ravonna Renslayer tries to judge Loki, but Owen Wilson’s Mobius saves him to use him to track a variant with sinister plans. Loki goes through a crash course on how his story was supposed to go, learning he’s responsible for Frigga’s (Rene Russo) death and how Thanos (Josh Brolin) kills him just after Ragnarok. Pairing this with seeing how the TVA agents use Infinity Stones as paperweights changes Loki’s perception of significance, and he decides to help Mobius – who reveals the variant they’re chasing is one of Loki himself.

Loki’s variant proves to be a handful, as it has the ability to inhabit other people’s bodies, particularly the TVA agents who are on the chase. Mobius’s theory of Loki being useful proves to be right, as he’s able to trace its steps and actions. He later makes a discovery – the variant is hiding in apocalypses, for nothing it does there will alter the course of the timeline. A quick trip to Pompeii proves Loki right, and they eventually track the variant at a Roxxcart store in 2050 Alabama, where a catastrophic hurricane is about to hit. Loki finally meets the variant, who happens to be a female Loki called Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino). And, while he’s indeed trying to help Mobius, he shares a determination with Sylvie to get to the bottom of it all and meet the Time-Keepers, so he tries to make a deal with her. She refuses and escapes – while powering up several time charges that send the timeline into disarray – but Loki goes after her, splitting from Mobius and crew.


**SYPNOSIS**
Loki Season 2 picks up in the aftermath of the shocking season finale when Loki finds himself in a battle for the soul of the Time Variance Authority. Along with Mobius, Hunter B-15, and a team of new and returning characters, Loki navigates an ever-expanding and increasingly dangerous Multiverse in search of Sylvie, Judge Renslayer, Miss Minutes, and the truth of what it means to possess free will and glorious purpose.
