**Story**

Lokiplunges the audience right into the action, borrowing the 2012 time heist scene from Avengers: Endgame to keep things clear about who this Loki is. He’s a variant who just tried to conquer Earth after the Battle of New York, who also manages to get ahold of the Tesseract and use it to escape to Mongolia, only for him to be trailed and arrested by agents from the Time Variance Agency. They reset that alternate timeline to its right course and take him to their headquarters – where anomalies that step out of the course of the Sacred Timeline (a.k.a. variants) are judged and/or pruned (a.k.a. disintegrated.)

In the TVA, Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s Ravonna Renslayer tries to judge Loki, but Owen Wilson’s Mobius saves him to use him to track a variant with sinister plans. Loki goes through a crash course on how his story was supposed to go, learning he’s responsible for Frigga’s (Rene Russo) death and how Thanos (Josh Brolin) kills him just after Ragnarok. Pairing this with seeing how the TVA agents use Infinity Stones as paperweights changes Loki’s perception of significance, and he decides to help Mobius – who reveals the variant they’re chasing is one of Loki himself.

Loki’s variant proves to be a handful, as it has the ability to inhabit other people’s bodies, particularly the TVA agents who are on the chase. Mobius’s theory of Loki being useful proves to be right, as he’s able to trace its steps and actions. He later makes a discovery – the variant is hiding in apocalypses, for nothing it does there will alter the course of the timeline. A quick trip to Pompeii proves Loki right, and they eventually track the variant at a Roxxcart store in 2050 Alabama, where a catastrophic hurricane is about to hit. Loki finally meets the variant, who happens to be a female Loki called Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino). And, while he’s indeed trying to help Mobius, he shares a determination with Sylvie to get to the bottom of it all and meet the Time-Keepers, so he tries to make a deal with her. She refuses and escapes – while powering up several time charges that send the timeline into disarray – but Loki goes after her, splitting from Mobius and crew.

After Roxxcart, they get to the TVA, but a discussion between her and Loki sends them to yet another impending apocalypse at Lamentis-1. Loki and Sylvie, while on a train that may take them out of the planet, bond over their experiences and similarities (confirming their bisexuality!), but their cover is blown. They’re thrown out of the train and their TemPad (the TVA’s traveling device, and their way out) disintegrates, stranding them in the impending doom of Lamentis-1. A defeated Sylvie explains how her mind-invading powers work, revealing an essential bit of information – the TVA agents are variants themselves, with no memory of their past lives.

While waiting for Lamentis-1 to be destroyed, Sylvie questions if a Loki’s destiny is to lose, but Loki refutes by saying their destiny is to survive. Mobius and Hunter B-15 (Wunmi Mosaku) track them when detecting a massive branch in the timeline (caused by Loki’s newfound love for her, a.k.a. falling for himself), rescuing both just in time. Loki tries to warn Mobius about the TVA’s deception, but is imprisoned in a time loop instead (where we get to see Jamie Alexander’s Sif once again!) Still, distrust starts to permeate both Mobius and Hunter B-15. Ravonna realizes this, pruning the first and arresting the latter. Loki and Sylvie are taken to the Time-Keepers, where Hunter B-15 arrives to help take them down, revealing they are fake animatronic figures. Just when Loki is about to admit his feelings for Sylvie, Ravonna prunes him too. Shortly afterwards, he’s welcomed by four of his variants into the Void.

Kid Loki (Jack Veal’s variant who killed Thor), Boastful Loki (DeObia Oparei’s show-off-y variant), Classic Loki (Richard E. Grant’s variant who escaped Thanos), and Alligator Loki (arrested by the TVA for eating the wrong neighbor’s cat) take Loki into their hideout, where they protect themselves from Alioth, a cloudlike beast who consumes everything that is sent to the Void. Sylvie, after pruning herself, gets to the Void and teams up with Mobius just in time to meet the Lokis and strategize on their next steps. Mobius decides to go back to the TVA, while Classic Loki sacrifices himself to help Loki and Sylvie go through Alioth and discover who’s really behind the TVA.

Loki and Sylvie are greeted by TVA’s Miss Minutes (Tara Strong) into He Who Remains’ (Jonathan Majors) citadel. She offers them to be able to coexist if they turn back, but they decide to go through and meet the man behind the curtain. The eccentric being explains how a variant of his unleashed a multiversal war that he was eventually able to contain by weaponizing Alioth, sealing off the Sacred Timeline. For ages, he’s been keeping everything under control, but now his time has arrived, leaving them with two options: kill him and face the horrors of his variants, or both of them taking his place as keepers of the timeline. It’s that point when they cross the threshold – he knew everything that was going to happen up to that moment, with the uncertain future now in the hands of Sylvie and Loki. A heated fight between them ends with Sylvie sending Loki back to the TVA and then killing He Who Remains, unleashing an infinite amount of alternate timelines.

Loki ends with him returning to a Ravonna-less TVA ruled by one of He Who Remains’ variants. Mobius and Hunter B-15 are scrambling to contain the timelines and don’t seem to remember Loki when he meets with them. The scope of Loki’s first season opens up a whole new world while honoring the Loki that died at the hands of Thanos, and making this version an instantaneously likable and empathic one. Though the multiple cliffhangers make it feel a bit incomplete, thankfully it's finally back to answer as many questions as its six episodes allow.

### LOKI SEASON 2


**EPISODES**

**SYNOPSIS**

Loki Season 2 picks up in the aftermath of the shocking season finale when Loki finds himself in a battle for the soul of the Time Variance Authority. Along with Mobius, Hunter B-15, and a team of new and returning characters, Loki navigates an ever-expanding and increasingly dangerous Multiverse in search of Sylvie, Judge Renslayer, Miss Minutes, and the truth of what it means to possess free will and glorious purpose.

**STORY**

Loki returns to the TVA but to its past and he begins to time slip between the past and present. While the folks in TVA feel the place is devoid of time, their claims make no sense. Think about it this way – if Mobius stands in the TVA and counts from 1 to 100. The moment he says 1 is in the past of the moment he says 100. What they don’t do in the TVA is age.

Everyone in the TVA has been informed that they are variants kidnapped from different branched timelines; their memories were wiped. In the past, Loki hears a recording of Renslayer and He Who Remains and learns they were in cahoots. B-15 convinces the council leader to stop pruning branches as it is genocide. Loki shows up in the present and reveals that the TVA is a front for He Who Remains.

Mobius takes Loki to Ouroboros for help. Loki slips to the past, and he asks the past Ouroboros for help, and he builds him a Temporal Aura Extractor. Loki slips back into the present, and by then, Ouroboros has already created the device. When they try to extract Loki, he time-slips into the future, where he sees Sylvia and is pruned just in time by an undisclosed person, allowing Mobius to save Loki in the present.

X-5 decides to settle down and become a movie star, Brad Wolfie, in one of the branched timelines in the year 1977. Mobuis and Loki find him and bring him back to TVA, and Loki threatens him till he discloses Sylvie’s whereabouts.

Loki goes to 1982 on a branched timeline to get Sylvie, who enchants X-5, to learn that Dox and her Minute-Men plan to destroy all branched timelines. Before Loki and team can stop her, they prune most of the branches. Distraught, Sylvie returns to her branched timeline with He Who Remains’ TemPad.

In 1868 of the Sacred Timeline, Renslayer arrives with Miss Minutes to drop the TVA guidebook into the house of an orphaned kid, Victor Timely. This event bootstraps Victor’s path to becoming a scientific genius. It appears that Victor is the one who sets up TVA in the future and becomes He Who Remains as Victor is from the Sacred Timeline (the prime MCU timeline). If Victor is not He Who Remains, then it means Kang from another timeline created the TVA which would be rather surprising.

In 1893, Loki shows up to take Victor back to the TVA, while Sylvie wants to kill him, and Renslayer wants him to take control of the TVA. Victor goes with Renslayer. Miss Minutes gets Victor to ditch Renslayer on the way and then discloses her love for Victor. Renslayer finds Victor, and so do Loki and Sylvie, who can’t get herself to kill Victor as he is presently innocent. Sylvie kicks Renslayer to the end of time and joins Loki to the TVA. What’s silly is that she doesn’t bother confiscating Renslayer’s TemPad and Miss Minutes. Or killing her after narrating how many times she’s killed her in her head.

Miss Minutes shows Renslayer a past recording of He Who Remains asking for her memory to be wiped along with everyone at the TVA.At the TVA, Victor meets Ouroboros to learn that Ouroboros’ book gave him all the knowledge, and Ouroboros wrote the book based on the works of Victor. The contents of the guidebook are part of a Bootstrap Paradox, a snake biting its own tail, the Ouroboros.

Victor and Ouroboros work together to figure out how to increase the Temporal Loom’s bandwidth to handle more branches. 

Renslayer travels to the TVA to talk to Dox and her minute-men, who refuse to follow Renslayer, and she kills them all. X-5 is spared as he joins Renslayer, and the two take Victor captive. Miss Minutes takes control of the TVA systems.

The ending of Loki Season 2 sees Loki deciding to sacrifice his future and embrace loneliness as he replaces He Who Remains as the caretaker of the multiverse. This also means that every timeline can now survive, leading to a potential multiversal war caused by Kang(s). In the final episode, Loki begins pushing his consciousness back through time to various points to understand how to learn the workings of the Temporal Loom and how to enhance it to support more branches. After travelling back in time and failing for centuries, Loki is able to successfully help Victor widen the Loom. But he soon learns that the Loom overloads anyway, as it has no way to support infinite branches.

Loki travels back to the point just before Sylvie kills He Who Remains, and no matter what he does to stop Sylvie from killing He Who Remains, Loki fails. Loki learns that the Temporal Loom is a failsafe, and its job is to automatically purge all the branches except for the Sacred Timeline in the event of an overload. He Who Remains also mentions Loki’s time-slipping was engineered by him so Loki can show up and kill Sylvie.

Loki goes back to when he first met Mobius to learn that Mobius couldn’t get himself to kill a variant kid, and Renslayer did the job instead. I’m unsure who this variant kid is; please comment below if anyone knows. Loki also goes back to talk to Sylvie and explain to her the predicament he’s facing. Sylvie says all the timelines need a fighting chance, and their destruction shouldn’t be one person’s decision.

**STORY**

America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) (A teenager who has the ability to travel between dimensions by punching open doorways) and a version of Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) (A neurosurgeon who became a Master of the Mystic Arts following a career-ending car accident) are chased by a demon in the space between universes while searching for the Book of Vishanti. That Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange's corpse to Earth-616, where that universe's version of Strange rescues Chavez from another demon with help from the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong (Benedict Wong) (The Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-616 and Strange's mentor and friend). Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through the multiverse. She cant control her powers and it manifests only when she is really frightened. Chavez says that the other Strange reached the book of Vishanti (which would give him the powers to defeat the demon), but that's when the Demon caught up with them and killed Strange. Chavez shows them the dead Strange's corpse as proof.

Recognizing witchcraft runes, Strange consults Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) (A former Avenger gone rogue who can harness chaos magic, engage in telepathy and telekinesis, and alter reality) for help but realizes that she is responsible for the attacks. After acquiring the Darkhold (the book of the damned that corrupts everyone) and becoming the Scarlet Witch, Maximoff believes that controlling Chavez's powers will allow her to reunite (by travelling to a different Universe, where they are still alive) with Billy (Julian Hilliard) and Tommy (Jett Klyne), the children she created during her time in Westview.

Maximoff gives an ultimatum to surrender Chavez by sundown. When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez, Maximoff attacks Kamar-Taj, killing many sorcerers. Under stress, Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange to Earth-838 (from where she cant go back as she cant control her powers. CHavez herself doesn't have a counterpart in any other universe) while Maximoff uses the Darkhold to "dream-walk" (Projecting her consciousness into her alternate from any other Universe), taking control of her Earth-838 counterpart, who lives a suburban life with her own Billy and Tommy. A surviving sorceress sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dream-walk. Enraged, Maximoff forces Wong to lead her to Mount Wundagore, the source of the Darkhold's power, to reestablish the dream-walk. There Maximoff realizes that Wundagore is a throne that has been waiting for her arrival. She was meant to rule all the multiverses.

While searching for help, Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Earth-838's Sorcerer Supreme, Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) (In this Universe Strange died trying to protect the Earth from Thanos), and brought before the Illuminati, a group consisting of Mordo, Peggy Carter / Captain Carter (Hayley Atwell), Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt (Anson Mount), Maria Rambeau / Captain Marvel (Lashana Lynch), Reed Richards (John Krasinski) (A member of the Fantastic 4), and Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). They explain that through reckless use of their universe's Darkhold in an attempt to defeat Thanos, Earth-838's Strange triggered a universe-destroying "incursion" (when boundaries between 2 universes are blurred, they collide, destroying one of both of the universes). After defeating Thanos (They found the book of Vishanti and used its powers to kill Thanos), the Illuminati executed their Strange to prevent him from causing more harm.

Mordo believes that Earth-616's Strange is similarly dangerous, but Maximoff reestablishes her dream-walk at Mount Wundagore and arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart's body before they can pass judgment. She kills all of the Illuminati except Mordo, whom Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The two escape with help from the Earth-838 counterpart of Strange's ex-fiance, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) (An emergency surgeon who was a colleague and lover of Strange), a scientist working with the Illuminati. Before dying Xavier had told Strange that 838 had the book of Vishanti. Strange convinces Palmer to take him to the way-point that leads to the book of Vishanti.

Strange, Chavez and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, which is the antithesis to the Darkhold, but Maximoff appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez's mind, using her powers to send the others to an incursion-destroyed universe. She also uses Chavez to send her back to Earth 616, where Maximoff disconnects the dream-walk with her 838 self.

Strange defeats the destroyed universe's Strange, who has been corrupted by his universe's Darkhold, and uses it to dream-walk into the body of his deceased counterpart on Earth-616. With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Maximoff as she tries to take Chavez's powers, and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. She transports Maximoff to Earth-838, where she sees Billy and Tommy recoil from her (the Wanda 616 who was in SCarlett witch headgear) in fear while crying for their real mother (whom Wanda 616 tossed aside when she entered the 616 universe). Realizing the error of her ways, Maximoff-616 relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore, simultaneously destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and apparently sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes.

Sometime later, Kamar-Taj is repaired and the surviving sorcerers, joined by Chavez, continue training. Strange develops a third eye as a result of using the Darkhold and dream-walking into a corpse.

In a mid-credits scene: Strange is approached by a sorceress who warns him that his actions have triggered an incursion that he must help fix. Strange follows her into the Dark Dimension.
